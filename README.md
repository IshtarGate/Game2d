# Game2d
2d side scrolling shooter and rts started in pygame

The game is in it's very initial stages.
I'm using the pygame library as a starting point.
I definitely have plans to move to another engine after this.

To play the most up to date version of the game, please open jupyterGameTestNotebook.ipynb

The main.py is currently behind the python notebook.
