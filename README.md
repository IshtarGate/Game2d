# Game2d
2d side scrolling shooter and rts started in pygame

The game is in its very initial stages.
I'm using the pygame library.
I definitely have plans to move to another engine after this.

To play the game you need python 3.5 installed and pygame for python 3.5.
Pygame is included in the extraLibs folder.
Then run Main.py
